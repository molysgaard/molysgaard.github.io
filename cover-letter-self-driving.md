# Cover letter

I believe I am an ideal candidate for the position of $position_name at $company_name. I would love to talk with you to
get to know $company_name more.

I am an R&D engineer as well as a team leader. My education has given me
a solid background in applied mathematics and physics, with a focus on
simulation, modeling, and implementation of this in C++/Rust.

\vspace{1em}
I co-founded a successful auto-follow drone startup, [The Staaker
Company](https://www.youtube.com/c/staaker), in 2014, as CTO, and led it
through its first product, mass production, and in the end, merger with
Nordic Unmanned.

Since 2018, I have conducted a hobby research project on nonlinear
constrained optimization. This project has resulted in software that can
achieve real-time 20Hz trajectory optimization for relatively complex
nonlinear models with hundreds of variables and constraints on a single
CPU core. The code is written in Rust. You can test a pre-compiled demo
running the trajectory optimizer for a 2D multirotor example in real-time
by going to my \href{http://www.mortenlysgaard.com/pages/trajectory-optimization-toolbox.html}{webpage}.

I have worked extensively with classical and modern controls, sensor
modeling, and state estimation as I developed The Staaker Drones
estimation and control stack.

An uncontrolled drone is dangerous. IÂ´m responsible for setting the
rules governing how we develop our code making it safe to fly. They
include low-level rules like code quality and memory management. And on
the high level: How can we guarantee our worst-case execution time? How
should our code-review culture be? I would love to talk more to you
about how we have achieved an unusually comprehensive design for safety.

I believe the key to having fun in my job and being valued, is finding
the place where my skills are the most productive. I think $company_name is such
a company. Self-driving technology could unlock large efficiency gains
in society, which I find a very fulfilling goal to work towards.

my work I can suggest taking a look at my homepage with videos and

Please contact me by phone or e-mail if you have any questions. I look
forward to hearing from you.
