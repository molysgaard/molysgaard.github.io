The Kontrol programming language is a Synchronous programming language.

The language is designed with inspiration from both [Lucid Synchrone](https://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/lucid-synchrone/index.html), [Lustre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lustre_(programming_language)), [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell), [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML) and [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).

It is currently implemented in Haskell.

It contains a REPL, and a code generator able to generate native machine code executing the update loop of the program.
