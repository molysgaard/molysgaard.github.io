## Education
Masters in applied mathematics and physics from NTNU Trondheim, Norway, with exchanges to QUT, Brinsbane, Australia and ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.
Focus on intersection between physics, mathematics and computer science during my whole education.

My masters thesis was part of a larger research project together with SINTEF.
The goal of the research project was to better understand the separation of oil and water happening in electrocoalecers on oil platforms. These are huge machines consuming enourmous amounts of electricity to
quickly separate oil from water when it is pumped up from undersea. Only a efficiency gain of 1% to such a process would be an enourmous acchievement.
A key part in understanding something, is being able to simulate it accurately. For my masters thesis i developed a two-phase, oil and water fluid simulation with electrohydrodynamics.
The simulation implemented a new technique, the immersed boundary method, to simulate the interface between the water and the oil. This allowed my simulation to acchieve a remarkably good accuracy
for the interface, letting us simulate things like oil-drop crumpling, which was not possible before.
My thesis received grade A, the highest possible grade.

## Summer job at Kongsberg

During the summer befor my last year in school. I had worked on a summer job at Kongsberg. There we developed an unmanned vertical takeoff airplane, from scratch!
The project was extremely ambitious, and extremely fun.
We developed our own airframe, had a Linux SOC with embedded FPGA so that we could create our own SPI/I2C drivers in VHDL, interfaced with one of the expensive Analog devices IMUs,
created control laws in simulink, and integrated them into the linux program.

My original responsebility was to be a part of the team that developed the glue software that was between the actual sensors and actuators, and our

## Staaker
The very positive experiences at Kongsberg lead me to realized that I wanted to utilize my skillset in robotics.
During the last year of my studies, I was on the lookout for like-minded studends, and came across a small team doing a start up called
Haukr.
They were developing a drone, that follows you and films you while you do cool actions sports.

I had an interview with them, and later that evening I got the email that I was in. And boy was I in.
During the day, I would write my masters thesis, and during the night, I would program control systems and estimators for the Staaker drone.
In Staaker, we were struggeling. We were 3 people wo knew how to code. Our founder, a mechanical engineer, and 2 marketing people.
None of us had previously worked in a real job, with this much freedom, and this much responsebility.
For us three developing the software, this materialized mostly in goal shifting to quickly, and little focus on anything else than "hacking it together". This worked, but we were not able to make a drone that would perform reliably.
After some months in the company, I felt compelled to take leadership of our technical development. I would lead the software and electronics development, and work together with our mechanical engineer.
I was able to cool down the rapidly shifting goals, and quite quickly our team stared to gain momentum now that we had a steady direction.

As I finished my masters in 2015, our company had matured considerably. We had a prototype that worked relatively reliably. We had secured funding from investors, and were very excited about our porduct.
I moved to Oslo in 2015, and the company followed in 2016. We moved in to our new offices in Fornebu.

By this point, we were still the original founder, and the three software developers, but our marketing and mechanical engineers had drifted away to
projects they found more interesting.
With the new investment, we could now for the first time afford to give out salaries, albeit not to ourselves.
e hired three new key positions. An experienced product designer, an experienced electrical engineer, and a chief of marketing.
