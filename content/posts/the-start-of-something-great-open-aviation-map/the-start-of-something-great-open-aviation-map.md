Ever since I took my private pilots license the thought of how old and
outdated my goverments aviation data is distributed have been coming
back to me once ever now and then. The thought started to grow in me and
today I've come far enough to say that I've started to do something with
the problem. I've started an open source mapping project. You've might
have heard of Open Street Map, the idéa goes like this:

> Let's create a website and software infrastructure that makes it
> really easy for the lay man to create a map. Then, instead of having
> to bother about drawing all these ways, junktions and houses, we'll
> just have to create the software that makes it really easy to do.

The thing is that they've come real far on this thought. Just take a
look at [OpenStreetMap](http://osm.org) and look at your local area.
Chanses are you see a really good map of roads, important houses etc.
Now comes the part that makes this map so different from all the other
maps around, Google, Bing etc.

-   This map is make by volunteers that just enjoy the feeling of
    creating something important and complex.
-   The map is completely free, you can do whatever you want with. You
    always have to share what you do with it under the same license.
    This makes sure that if someone does a really smart thing; everyone
    benefits from it which I think is really neat!

What I've done is blatantly copy OpenStreetMaps philosophy and
software architecture and used it for aviation data. To take a look at
the page go to [OpenAviationMap](http://openaviationmap.org). | It lets
hobby aviators around the world stick their heads together and create a
world map for flying! | Already before things are stable Germany has a
load of data, thanks to Udo Geschonneck who's done a great job adding
the navaids and started some aerodromes there. | If one man can create
that much data in just a few days, then creating a world map maybe
issn't such a crazy idéa afterall.
