I got a joyous mail in my inbox today. Mark Roberts wants to implement a
distributed merkele tree over my DHT Sirkel. The algorithms he's aiming
to implement is described
in:Â <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.73.2699>\
I've been wanting to do this myself, but haven't found the time. Mark is
going to do this as a part of his distributed systems cource. I'm going
to help him both on a conceptual and implementation-wise. I'll update
when there's more to know. Untill now, I'm happy to know that Sirkel may
be the first DHT I know of that implements real content authentication!
