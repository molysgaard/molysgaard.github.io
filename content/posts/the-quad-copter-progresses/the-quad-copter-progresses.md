summary: 'New frame and flightcontroller and the drone is now flying quite well'
---

I've done a good deal of tinkering since the last post. A new frame was
ordered from HobbyKing, replacing the homemade one. This got rid of the
vibrations that the pine one had problems with. I also changed the
controller ho a Kaptein KUK controller. It's much simpler and cheaper.
That way I can try out and experiment whitout worrying about crashing.
Here are two videos of the new version flying.\
This one was done right after I had changed the frame, see the
difference is stability.

In this one i stuck my mobile phone to the copter and did some flying
around the garden at home in RÃ¸ros.
