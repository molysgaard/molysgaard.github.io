Yeah, this weekend I've been having some freetime so I used it on my
Arducopter project. Here's a picture of the finished build:

The chassis was made by hand at OmegaV. It's just some pine spars, plexi
glass, nuts and bolts. Experiences from the first flight where theese:
The chassis is a bit to wobbely, vibrations build up. The Arducopter was
tuned a bit too sloppy, so it flies a bit docile. I think I'll order a
industry made chassis because it costs next to nothing and they are much
more stiff. I'm also going to buy a cheap KK controller just for
experimenting. That way I can crash as much as I want whitout being
worried about the bill. Last but not least, here's a video of the
flight.
