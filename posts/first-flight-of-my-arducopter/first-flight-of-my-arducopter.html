<p>Yeah, this weekend I've been having some freetime so I used it on my Arducopter project. Here's a picture of the finished build: \[caption id=&quot;attachment_130&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;]<a href="http://mortenlysgaard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/quad.jpg"><img src="http://mortenlysgaard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/quad.jpg" alt="image0" class="wp-image-130" width="500" height="400" /></a></p>

The chassis was made by hand at OmegaV. It's just some pine spars, plexi glass, nuts and bolts. Experiences from the first flight where theese: The chassis is a bit to wobbely, vibrations build up. The Arducopter was tuned a bit too sloppy, so it flies a bit docile. I think I'll order a industry made chassis because it costs next to nothing and they are much more stiff. I'm also going to buy a cheap KK controller just for experimenting. That way I can crash as much as I want whitout being worried about the bill. Last but not least, here's a video of the flight.</p>
