Today I scrapped together some of my old parts to see if I could make
something new, the result was this. The airframe is made of some scrap
materials and it does not have a real airfoil. The powertrain comes from
two brushless motors and accompanying speed controllers from an old
scrapped 450 size quadcopter. The flight controller is an extremely
cheap NanoWii MultiWii controller configured as a bicopter. I had
serious doubts that it would even get off the ground but after a failed
attempt with a two cell battery. I slapped a three cell on the plane,
the result is below:

There is still a long way to go before this can be called successfull
VTOL concept, but it would be really interesting to see how far it is
possible to push this hybrid flying wing design.

Stay tuned!
