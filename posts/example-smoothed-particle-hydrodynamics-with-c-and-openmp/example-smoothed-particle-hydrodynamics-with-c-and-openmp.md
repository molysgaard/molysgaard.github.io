I am interested in ways of approximating differential equations
numerically. Yeasterday I read up on the basics of Smoothed-Particle
Hydrodynamics, or SPH for short. It is a way of approximating a PDE
using a finite set of particles that represent a quantity, eg. a fluid.
To read more about the basics of the method take a look at this
[PDF](http://image.diku.dk/kenny/download/vriphys10_course/sph.pdf).\
The algorithm was first prototyped is Octave (Matlab) and found to slow.
Then I coded a native C version with SDL graphics and OpenMP to speed up
some of the calculations, it worked pretty well. The code is available
at my [GitHub](https://github.com/molysgaard/navierstokes). A video
showing the live rendering is embedded below.\

As the video shows the liquid is extremely pressure driven and thus
does not represent incompressible liquids, like water. The physical
correctness of this simulation as a whole has to be taken with a grain
of salt because of the extremely simple implementation. But it serves as
a very *visual* way of communicating how the method works and what
strengths/weaknesses it has. | One nice property is that the method
conserves mass.
